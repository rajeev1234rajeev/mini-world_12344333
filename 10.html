    <p>The HTML structure consists of a container div with the class "course-section" that encapsulates the entire course section.
        Inside the container, we have an h2 heading with the text "Featured Courses" to introduce the section.
        The course cards are structured using the "course-card" class, containing an image, course title, and brief description.
        The course cards are displayed in a grid layout using the "course-grid" class.
        The CSS styling provides padding and defines the layout for the course section and cards.
        The "course-card" class sets the background color, padding, and border radius for each course card.
        The image inside each course card is styled to occupy 100% width while maintaining its aspect ratio.
        The hover effect is implemented using the ":hover" pseudo-class, which applies a translation and box-shadow effect to the course card when hovered over by the user</p>
